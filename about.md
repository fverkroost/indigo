<p>Hi! I am Florianne and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Economics, Econometrics and Finance of the Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Groningen. My research uses (Bayesian) statistics, machine and deep learning, agent-based simulations and big (digital trace) data to study the accumulation of socio-economic inequalities across domains and stages of life. As a postdoc, I am lucky to be part of a talented team of researchers doing similar work as part of the [MapIneq](https://mapineq.eu) project. Before starting at the University of Groningen, I obtained my PhD (DPhil) at Nuffield College, University of Oxford.</p>
