<p>Hi! I am Florianne and I have recently obtained my PhD at the University of Oxford. I am passionate about applying my interdisciplinary knowledge and skills to address complex, real-world problems in business and society. Hereby, I make extensive use of advanced computational methods and innovative digital data. Methodologically, I am interested in (Bayesian) statistics, machine and deep learning, agent-based simulations and big data manipulation. My current research and substantive interests span socio-economic inequalities by gender and parental status as well as tracking digital global gender gaps.</p>
