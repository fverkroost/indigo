A [new article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00294-7), co-authored with Ridhi Kashyap has now been published in EPJ Data Science. In this article, we explore professional global gender gaps, 
leveraging novel and aggregate data on user counts from LinkedIn, the world's largest professional networking platform. We show how women are significantly underrepresented relative to men on LinkedIn in general and that a simple, aggregate indicator of the female-to-male ratio of LinkedIn users shows strong positive correlations with International Labor Organization ground truth professional gender gaps. Additionally, we explore biases in the LinkedIn data, coming from a non-representative online population. Our work contributes to a growing literature seeking to harness the ‘data revolution’ for global sustainable development by evaluating the potential of a novel data source for filling gender data gaps and monitoring key indicators linked to women’s economic empowerment.
